# PINNs & Deep Fourier Residal Benchmark (Keras Core) - JAX & TensorFlow.

PINNs & Deep Fourier Residual Benchmark (Keras Core) - JAX & TensorFlow. Benchmarking for efficient PDE solving with NN.

Welcome to the "PINNs and Deep Fourier Residual Method Benchmark" repository, a collaborative effort by the MATHMODE group (https://www.mathmode.science/). Our goal is to provide a comprehensive benchmarking platform for different basic implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the Deep Fourier Residual Method (DFR), all based on the versatile Keras Core framework.
